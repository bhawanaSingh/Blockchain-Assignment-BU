### Blockchain-Assignment-BU
#### Assignment 1: Creation of Blocks and Analyzing the Block header components like previous hash, timestamp, etc. 
In this assignment, we learn about the Block and Merkle tree. 
Follow the steps to run the program:
1. Create a MerkleTree.sol file in the Remix IDE.
2. Insert the code.
3. Compile the program.
4. Deploy the program
5. Insert inputs to check whether the "True" is visible in the output. 


#### Assignment 2: Set up a MetaMask Ethereum wallet on the web browser and create crypto wallets to transfer funds. Performing input/output transactions using private and public keys of the crypto wallet and estimating gas price, and gas limit.
In this assignment, we learn how we can create MetaMask account and send fake GoreliETH using MetaMask wallet to the receiver's account. Also, check the gas price required to send these GoreliETH to receiver's account. 

#### Assignment 3: Make use of Ethereum public Blockchain test networks like Goreli, Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai networks to perform transactions and view on Goreli Etherscan. 
We deploy an ERC20 token smart contract on the Remix IDE and execute that smart contract on Goreli test nework with the help of MetaMask Wallet. 
Follow the steps to run the program:
1. Create a BhawanaToken.sol file in the Remix IDE.
2. Insert the raw code written in BhawanaToken.sol file.
3. select the BhawanaToken.sol file and compile it.
4. Select Injected MetaMask -- Wallet option in enviorment.
5. login to the MetaMask Wallet using password (private key) and select the test network as "Goreli".
6. Click on deploy option. Remeber select the "BhawanaToken.sol" file in the contract option.
7. MetaMask will trigger a popup which indicate the gas fee for deployment of this ERC20 contract on the Goreli test network.
8. Click on confirm option.
9. Once you confirm it start incdicating the status of your deplyed contract.
10. Now click on the deployed contract and view it on the block explorer. Here you can see that 10,00,000 ERC20 tokenS with name bhawana (BH) is created.
